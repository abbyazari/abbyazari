### Hello :wave: 

I'm a planetary space physicist pursuing probabilistic machine learning and inverse methods for scientific insight; I'm currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Alberta and a researcher at the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute. 

- :satellite:  previously [worked](https://dsi.ubc.ca/projects/2023/gaussian-processes-advancing-understanding-planetary-magnetism-spacecraft) on applications of Gaussian processes for planetary magnetism and space physics.
- :earth_americas:  am excited about the use of machine learning for [understanding](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i128/release/1) our planet and others. 
- :telescope:  enjoy interacting in the [DeepSkies](https://deepskieslab.com/) community. 
- :moon:  founded the Machine Learning for Planetary and Space Physics journal club, join at [ml4psp.github.io](https://ml4psp.github.io/).
- :link:  see [abbyazari.github.io](https://abbyazari.github.io/) for my research.
