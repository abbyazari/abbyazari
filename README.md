### Hello :wave: 

I'm a planetary space physicist pursuing machine learning methods for uncertainty quantification and scientific insight; I'm currently a Data Science Fellow and Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of British Columbia.

- :satellite:  currently [working](https://dsi.ubc.ca/projects/2023/gaussian-processes-advancing-understanding-planetary-magnetism-spacecraft) on applications of Gaussian processes for planetary magnetism and space physics.
- :earth_americas:  am excited about the use of machine learning for [understanding](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n4i128/release/1) our planet and others. 
- :telescope:  enjoy interating in the [DeepSkies](https://deepskieslab.com/) community. 
- :moon:  founded the Machine Learning for Planetary and Space Physics journal club, join at [ml4psp.github.io](https://ml4psp.github.io/).
- :link:  see [abbyazari.github.io](https://abbyazari.github.io/) for my research.
