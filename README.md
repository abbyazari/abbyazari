### Hello! 

I'm a planetary space physicist pursuing machine learning methods for uncertainty quantification and scientific insight; I'm currently a Data Science Fellow and Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of British Columbia.

- :satellite: currently [working](https://dsi.ubc.ca/projects/2023/gaussian-processes-advancing-understanding-planetary-magnetism-spacecraft) on applications of Gaussian processes for planetary magnetism.
- :earth_americas: am excited about the use of machine learning for understanding our planet and others. 
- :telescope: enjoy interating in the [DeepSkies](https://deepskieslab.com/) community. 
- :moon: founded the Machine Learning for Planetary and Space Physics journal club, join at [ml4psp.github.io](https:://ml4psp.github.io).
- :link: see [abbyazari.github.io](abbyazari.github.io) for my research.
